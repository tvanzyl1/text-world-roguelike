#TextWorld
Using simple libraries I played with writing a simple roguelike game. An ASCII world to explore. Evading zombies and try to survive.

## Features
* So far I generate a world from bmp resource files and explore.
* 100x100 screens to explore.
* Pickup food, water and healing stuff so you don't die.
* Grab guns, knives, axes and even a sledge hammer.
* Use the axe to chop trees and sledge to break through generated building walls.
* Then there are the odd zombie lurking in populated areas.
* Main library used: http://slashie.net/libjcsi/

P.S. Please note that I'm not developer and that the result which is this little game is what happens when I slap a few java files together. There is no proper structure and duplicated code and services all over.
